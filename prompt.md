## Prompt 1
I want to create a shopping list chrome extension using html, css, and javascript.
The extension should let users save the URL of the current browser tab

When a user opens the chrome extension on a page with an item they like, they should be able to select the category and then click a "Save Item" button to add the tab's URL to a list displayed below. The shopping list should display each item's link next to the category.

The categories to select should be "Books, Clothes, Shoes, Electronics, Pets, Health"

Please suggest a step-by-step guide to help me get started.

## Prompt 2
The user should see a preview of the item name before selecting a category and saving it to their list.

Both the preview and shopping list links should display an item's name by accessing the current tab 's title element. Please truncate the item name to 50 characters.

The saved items should display even after closing or refreshing a browser.

## Prompt 3
Allow the user to delete items from the shopping list permanently.
Each delete button should display a "delete" icon using an icon font

## Prompt 4 
Finally, display the saved item links as separate lists based on their category.

Please provide all of the fully updated code with detailed comments.
